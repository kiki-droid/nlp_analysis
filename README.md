Basic spam, sentiment and parts of speech analysis using nltk, transformers, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and spacy, with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using data visualization methods to summarize key characteristics and identify patterns.

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is a process of analyzing and summarizing data sets to gain insights into the underlying patterns, relationships, and distributions of the data. The goal of EDA is to understand the data and its properties, to identify any anomalies or outliers, and to gain a general understanding of the data before applying any statistical techniques or building predictive models.

Some of the key techniques used in EDA include:

1. Summary statistics: Calculating basic summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range can provide a quick overview of the data and help identify any patterns or trends.

2. Data visualization: Creating plots and charts, such as histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots, can help visualize the distribution of the data and identify any outliers or unusual patterns.

3. Correlation analysis: Calculating correlation coefficients between pairs of variables can help identify any relationships or dependencies between them.

4. Hypothesis testing: Conducting statistical tests, such as t-tests or ANOVA, can help identify any significant differences or relationships between groups or variables.

5. Dimensionality reduction: Using techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or factor analysis can help identify underlying patterns or structures in high-dimensional data.

The results of EDA can be used to guide further analysis, such as building predictive models or generating new hypotheses for further investigation. EDA is an important part of the data analysis process and can help ensure that any conclusions drawn from the dataare based on a thorough understanding of the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. It can also help identify any data quality issues, such as missing values or inconsistent data, which may need to be addressed before further analysis can be conducted.
